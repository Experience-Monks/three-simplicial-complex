Creates a THREE.Geometry from a 3D simplicial complex. See [demo](test.js) for an example.

```js
var Complex = require('three-simplicial-complex')(THREE)

var mesh = {
    positions: [ [25,25,25], [15,15,25], [50,50,25], [15,15,15], ... ],
    cells: [ [0,1,2], [1,3,2], ...]
}

var complex = Complex(mesh)
complex.position.x = 2
scene.add(complex)
```

This is useful for inter-op with modules like [icosphere](https://www.npmjs.org/package/icosphere), [bunny](https://www.npmjs.org/package/bunny), [stanford-dragon](https://www.npmjs.org/package/stanford-dragon), [mesh-combine](https://www.npmjs.org/package/mesh-combine), [extrude-polyline](https://www.npmjs.org/package/extrude-polyline), [teapot](https://www.npmjs.org/package/teapot), [triangulate-contours](https://www.npmjs.org/package/triangulate-contours), etc.

## Usage

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/three-simplicial-complex.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/three-simplicial-complex/)

#### `geo = Complex([mesh])`

Creates a new THREE.Geometry with the given complex (optional), where `mesh` contains `{ positions, cells }`.

#### `geo.update(mesh)`

Updates the THREE.Geometry with the new simplicial complex.

#### Versioning

This uses an unusual versioning system to better support ThreeJS's (lack of) versioning. The major version of this repo will line up with ThreeJS releases (`69.0.0` => `r69`). The minor will be reserved for any new features, and patch for bug fixes and documentation/readme updates. In some rare cases, a minor feature may introduce a breaking change; so it's generally safest to use tilde or `save-exact` for this module.
